I am a hard working and ambitious recent graduate of Makers Academy looking for my first software development job. 

Before becoming a developer I was the first IT employee at Bulb, then the UKâ€™s fastest growing start up. During my time there I helped the company rapidly scale by bringing IT in-house, implementing dozens of systems and processes and providing exceptional technical support. 

Iâ€™m a great problem solver and communicator who is always learning new skills (currently React).

## Skills

**Fast learner, self-reliant**  
When I began taking over IT responsbilities at Bulb I had no formal training or mentor, only a reputation for being technically savvy. Everything I learnt to perform my job I taught myself. This was recognised by the company when I was made the first IT employee.

**Problem solver, logical thinker**  
During the first lockdown I had to come up with a solution so that the company could continue to hire and onboard employees. I worked closely with the HR and L&D teams to make sure that every joiner received their laptop ahead of their start date. As there could be no on hand support I created a detailed guide that enabled users to onboard themselves. I refined this after each cohort to address any issues that had occured resulting in a completely self led and problem free process.

**Communication**  
Being a great communicator was essential when providing technical support to users. I had to ask the right questions to gather the relevant information about their issue and then, once I had a solution, explain what steps had to be taken to resolve it at a level they could understand. I frequently received positive feedback about my ability to explain complex tasks and a simple manner.

**Project management**  
I planned and implemented OneLogin, an identity platform, for the entire company. This was a multi month project involving dozens of stakeholders. Each system or service required integration testing followed by sending out company wide comms informing users of the upcoming changes and what new actions they would need to take. The project was delivered with next to no issues due to the thorough planning I undertook.
